# Fine-Tune-BERT-for-Text-Classification-with-TensorFlow

<h1>BERT</h1>
<P>BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) is a natural language processing (NLP) model developed by Google. It is designed to understand the context of words in a sentence by analyzing them in both directions (left and right) simultaneously.</P>

<H3>Key Features of BERT:</H3>
<ol>1. <b>Bidirectional Understanding – </b>Unlike earlier models that read text in one direction (left to right or right to left), BERT reads in both directions to gain a deeper understanding of word meaning.</ol>
<ol>2. <b>Transformer-Based Architecture –</b> Uses the Transformer model, which relies on self-attention mechanisms to process words in relation to all other words in a sentence.</ol>
<ol><b>Pretrained on Large Text Data –</b>3. Initially trained on Wikipedia and BooksCorpus, then fine-tuned for specific NLP tasks.</ol>
<ol><b>4. Improves NLP Tasks –</b> Enhances search engine results, text classification, question answering, and sentiment analysis by better understanding natural language.</ol>
